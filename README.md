# AstroNvim Template

**NOTE:** This is for AstroNvim v4+

This is johnstegeman's (aka Steggy) nvim configuration based on Astronvim v4. Note that it has some keybindings that are tailored for the Colemak DH keyboard layout, so if you are on QWERTY or other layout, be sure to review the mappings in lua/plugins/astrocore.lua and remove/edit the Colemak mappings
